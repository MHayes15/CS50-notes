## Problem set 0

Nothing this week, assigment was to mess around on Scratch. I created a program that displayed pictures of different instruments. Using the music extension, I was able to make each instrument play its corresponding sound. I also used the text-to-speech extension, which allowed me to implement lyrics. The user could also change the singer's voice using a slidebar at the top of the screen.
